                <h3><a href="https://www.zara.com/us/">Bad Website: Zara</a></h3>
                <p><strong>Descripition:</strong> Zara's website is an online fashion retail store where users can browse, purchase, and explore the latest clothing, accessories, and footwear collections for men, women, and kids. It features a clean, minimalist design with high-quality images, easy navigation, and options for home delivery or in-store pickup.</p>
                <div class="bullet-points">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>All of the text is super small except for the Zara logo so you don't know what is important.</li>
                                <li>On the help page they put text over an image which is hard to read.</li>
                                <li>In the footer of the website, there cookie policy link is highlighted in green making the text hard to read.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>On the home page, there is a section of just blue on the white page.</li>
                                <li>There is a mixture of big, medium, and small photos</li>
                                <li>There are gallery sections with photos and sometimes videos mixed in.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>On most of the pages, the content is aligned consistently.</li>
                                <li>When moving through the galleries by clicking and dragging, it ruins the alignment</li>
                                <li>The alignment of text in the side menu could be better</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>There is spacing between different sections of content</li>
                                <li>Side menu items are grouped together but the grouping could be better</li>
                                <li>When looking through products, a new section is established through a heading on the sides which is confusing</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Overall assessment:</strong> Zara has does not follow CRAP principles very well. They have poor contrast, inconsistent repetition, sometimes good alignment, and fairly decent proximity. Other notable things include a broken side and top bar menu as well as having to click and drag to move the gallery images or categories in the side bar menu. There is no indiciator to click and drag these things.</p>

                                <li>Filters are along the left and relevant produt information on the right.</li>
                                <li>The top menu bar items are spaced and aligned evenly.</li>
                                <li>It has a neat and even feeling between sections of content.</li>

                <p><strong>Overall assessment:</strong> Amazon follows the CRAP principles much better than Zara. It provides good contrast on the page, consistent repetition for the user, aligns everything in a neat and professional manner, and relevant items are grouped together in proximity to one another.</p>
