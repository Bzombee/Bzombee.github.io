                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Files and Links:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>No link from course page to client project and all header links work</li>
                                <li>Design firm link in footer doesn't work</li>
                                <li>File names have capital letters such as image names</li>
                                <li>The client website should be standalone (for instance, you should have a scripts folder in your project folder for the scripts for the pages)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Page Design:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Buttons have low contrast between text and background. All of the text is bolded in the Triva when it probably shouldn’t be.</li>
                                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent style across the pages.</li>
                                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All of the elements are sprawled across the page. Since everything is centered, none of the paragraphs or lists line up together on the page (the bullets are not next to their sentences).</li>
                                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Everything feels really close together. Also consider adding some spacing between the main content and the footer (notable on the Ways To Get Involved Page). When hovering over an image in the slideshow, it covers some of the page’s contents.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Page Elements:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Has the elements: header (not dynamic), main (<em>need to add</em>), footer (not dynamic), and nav (needs to be in header element).</li>
                                <li>Header has a: h1 text, brand, and no page name text (your page name is currently in the header).</li>
                                <li>h1 should be the name of the website and h2 the name of the page.</li>
                                <li>Footer has has relevant stuff, check links.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Assignment Requirements:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Has five functional pages (except slideshows on CLT webpage version).</li>
                                <li>A home page named index.html.</li>
                                <li>A working and consistent nav bar.</li>
                                <li>4 other working pages with content for each</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Additional notes:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>On the CLT webpage version, the scripts do not work. Make sure they are uploaded to the web server!</li>
                                <li>Do not center paragraphs and bulleted lists. Instead create a main element and restrict its size.</li>
                                <li>Add some media rules for bigger and smaller screens.</li>
                                <li>Clicking on the Accumulus Cloud and then WCAG will reveal contrast and other warnings in the code.</li>
                                <li><strong>This website is heading in the right direction, just keep tweaking the styling and it’ll be amazing!</strong></li>
